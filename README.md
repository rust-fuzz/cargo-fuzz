# Cargo-fuzz

Commandline wrapper for using libFuzzer. Easy to use, no need to recompile LLVM!


libFuzzer needs LLVM sanitizer support, so this is x86-64 Linux-only for now. This also needs a nightly since it uses some unstable commandline flags.

This crate is currently under some churn -- in case stuff isn't working, please reinstall it (`cargo install cargo-fuzz -f`), and delete the cloned `libfuzzer-sys` folder in the `fuzz/` folder. Rerunning `cargo fuzz --init` after moving your `fuzz` folder and updating this crate may get you a better generated `fuzz/Cargo.toml`. Expect this to settle down soon.

## Installation

```sh
$ cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## Usage

First, set up your project for fuzzing:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/project
$ cargo fuzz --init
```

This will create a `fuzz` folder, containing a fuzzing script called `fuzzer_script_1` in the
`fuzzers/` subfolder. It is generally a good idea to check in the files generated by `--init`.

libFuzzer is going to repeatedly call the `go()` function in the fuzzer script with a byte buffer
`data` of length `size`, until your program hits an error condition (segfault, panic, etc). Write
your `go()` function to hit the entry point you need.

You can add more fuzz target scripts via `cargo fuzz --add name_of_script`. There
is a `Cargo.toml` in the `fuzz/` folder where you can add dependencies.


To fuzz a fuzz target, run:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/project
$ cargo fuzz --fuzz-target fuzzer_script_1 # or whatever the target is named
```

Then, wait till it finds something!
